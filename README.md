`CFMesh` is a mesh-handling utility library, it is designed to support the common operations
required by mesh-based codes, principally mesh reading and partitioning.
It is intended for use in an HPC environment so, in addition to reading mesh files that are often
written for workstation use, `CFMesh` supports writing the partitioned mesh in an HPC-focused format
for use in subsequent runs.
